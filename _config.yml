          A recipe generator that creates balanced meals tailored to your exact protein, fat, and carbohydrate needs.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I built this website to simplify the process of cooking while tracking macros, which can often be time-consuming and tedious. By entering your target calories, protein, and food preferences, the app uses the <mark>ChatGPT 3.5 API</mark> to generate seven recipes in parallel and selects the one that best matches your input—removing the hassle of calculating portions and finding ingredients so you can get straight to cooking.
